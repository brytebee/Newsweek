# USING BOOTSTRAP (THE NEWSWEEK PROJECT)
***
This project consists of replicating the The Newsweek website with emphasis on how it behaves differently depending on the size of the screen where the website is rendered.
Using a mobile first approach we added two other breakpoints for tablets and desktops.

## Built with:
I have built this section of the website using:

* HTML5 semantic tags,

* CSS3 (Media Queries, Grid system).

* Bootstrap (Grids).
